Survivors will conclude the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet! The saga is now complete, and hundreds of hours of new story-oriented ARK gameplay await you!Purchased as part of the ARK: Genesis Season Pass you gain access to two new huge story-oriented expansion packs -- Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2 (new!) -- as well as a 'Noglin' Chibi cosmetic, a Shadowmane Chibi cosmetic, a new cosmetic armor set, and an in-game, artificially intelligent companion called HLN-A who can scan additional hidden Explorer Notes found throughout the other ARKs. Features the voiceover talent of David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) as in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A/Helena Walker.https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113410/ARK_Genesis_Season_Pass/About the GameAs a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well youve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARKs god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, youll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example.

Choose your noble house and lead your dynasty to greatness in a Middle Ages epic that spans generations. War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning. Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned or not. Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced. Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices. Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence. Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts. Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm. The paths to follow are limitless: experience thousands of dynamic events and life-altering decisions tailored to each and every conceivable situation and character. There are countless ways of securing and keeping your place in the history books.

Its designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the random events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.Your colonists are not professional settlers theyre crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. Youll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.Each persons background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill but he does that very well.Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.And there's much more than that!

This new season moves the contest from the rugged, enclosed indoor arenas to the lush forests, rolling fields, and rugged terrains of TEC1s own private SCUM Island. Both fan favorites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of survival while battling for the support of viewers, producers, and corporate sponsors for fame, gifts, and a chance of life after death.SCUM aims to evolve the multiplayer open world survival game with unprecedented levels of character customization, control and progression, where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival. Combining the methodical planning and management of hardcore survival with optional PvP network events available to everyone at anytime, SCUM strikes a unique balance between complex simulation and intense action in the next generation of survival game. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev updates on scumgame.com and on Twitter @SCUMgame.FEATURES [ALPHA]Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems to allow players to go as deep as they choose into the management of their character. Players can delve into the minutia of the survival experience through systems controlling their characters metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details...Massive Landscape: Traverse and explore 225 sq km of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns, and rundown airfields. Each location telling it's own story and filled with wildlife and dangers.The massive terrain can be traversed by foot, land vehicles, boats or aircraft.PvP Network Events: Enter TEC1s ongoing network events with a click of a button and be whisked to enclosed areas of the island for white-knuckle PvP gameplay. Volunteer for an event and be pitted against other prisoners with fame points and high value loot on the line for those that survive.Expanding Gameplay: While the current version of SCUM already includes basic crafting, combat, and customization systems, the featureset and gameplay will continually expand to include more advanced mechanics, more variety in gameplay, and a metanarrative for players to complete missions with hopes of one day getting off the island...Online Multiplayer: Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server right from the in-game menu.

Characters are the beating heart of the game, and Chinas very future will be shaped by its champions.GUANXI SYSTEMModelled on Guanxi, the Chinese concept of dynamic inter-relationships, Total War: THREE KINGDOMS takes a paradigm-shifting approach to character agency, with iconic, larger-than-life heroes and their relationships defining the future of ancient China. Each of these characters is brought to life with their own unique personality, motivations, and likes/dislikes. They also form their own deep relationships with each other, both positive and negative, that shape how your story plays out.ARTISTIC PURITYWith stunning visuals and flamboyant Wushu combat, THREE KINGDOMS is the art of war. With beautiful UI, vibrant vistas and authentic Chinese-inspired artwork, this reimagining of ancient China is a visual feast.REAL-TIME & TURN-BASED HARMONYThe turn-based campaign and real-time battles of Total War: THREE KINGDOMS are more interconnected than ever before. Actions in battle now have much greater consequences, affecting your Heroes relationship towards you, as well as the friendships and rivalries they develop with other characters. In a world where powerful allies are one of the keys to success, this adds a brand-new element to how victory is achieved.",https://www.totalwar.com/,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 64 BitProcessor: Intel i5-6600 | Ryzen 5 2600XMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: GTX 970 | R9 Fury X 4GB VRAMDirectX: Version 11Storage: 60 GB available space,"['CREATIVE ASSEMBLY', 'Feral Interactive (Mac)', 'Feral Interactive (Linux)']","['SEGA', 'Feral Interactive (Mac)', 'Feral Interactive (Linux)']","['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'LAN PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'LAN Co-op', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Cloud']",,'total': 64014,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 64 BitProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo 3.00GhzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: GTX 650 Ti 1GB|HD 7850 1GB|Intel UHD Graphics 620DirectX: Version 11Storage: 60 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: 6GB Memory if using integrated GPU,True,True,True,False,"23 May, 2019",85.0,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/total-war-three-kingdoms?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,125,True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive.FEATURESFreeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No ""hero"" characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a ""game"", you are living and surviving in a simulated world.Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A characters stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment.

In the distant future, the power of science and technology has ushered a new age to the human race. Space and time have become irrelevant thanks to virtual reality. A new kind of supercomputer has been developed a machine whose superior artificial intelligence and computing capability will push humanity even further. There is only one problem: there isnt enough energy in the whole planet to feed this machine. You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that humanity needs. Only a few decades ago, Dyson Spheres were considered a hypothetical, impossible invention but now its in your hands Will you be able to turn a backwater space workshop into a galaxy-wide industrial production empire? Neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, gaseous and rocky planets There is a big and varied universe out there, waiting for you to gather all its resources. Every playthrough will be unique: your universe will be procedurally generated every time you start a new game. There will be different types and distribution of stars, planets and resources. Will you manage to thrive and build your Spheres, no matter what the universe throws at you? As a space engineer, you are expected to design your interstellar factory and production lines, not to micromanage every small package going back and forth. You have to transport materials from one planet to another, forming interstellar transport teams that gather resources and bring them to where they are needed.

Amidst this catastrophe, how will you survive?SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP:SL), is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game, inspired by the SCP universe. The game centers around the Foundation's mission to protect humanity from the dangerous creatures and entities that threaten it. However, with the involvement of the Chaos Insurgency, this quickly introduces both conflict and turmoil their forces acting against the Foundation's, to create a future in which humanity rules. With every round comes new experiences, threats, and dangers. There are multiple ways to survive this nightmarish ordeal, but none are without risk. You will fight for survival with every faction: SCP entities running amok with the intent to escape; The infamous Chaos Insurgents, working to undermine the Foundation; MTF and Foundation Security forces, mobilizing to secure the Facility at all costs; and armed Scientists and Class-D Personnel who refuse to accept death as an answer.

In your mad dash for freedom, you may find yourself being disintegrated by a Tesla Gate, or being blown into ashes by a last-minute nuclear explosion. Site-02 is an unforgiving place. Stay alert, adhere to protocol(s), and above all else stay alive.SCP:SL was initially inspired by the well-known single-player horror game, SCP Containment Breach (2012) by Undertow Games.

Thousands of ships and stations trade, mine and produce, all realistically simulated. In this universe, you can grow from being the lone pilot of a fighter ship, to managing a vast empire, commanding your fleets and designing colossal space stations. Transition seamlessly from first-person action, boarding ships and visiting their bridges, to an expansive strategy and management simulation. Choose your own path at your own pace. The decisions are yours. Trade - Fight - Build - Think.Start your journeyIn X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide.Fly every shipX4 allows you to fly all ships personally. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.Build space stations and upgrade your shipsBuilding space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.Experience the most dynamic X universe everX4 is the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe.Manage your empire with a powerful mapOnce you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.Dive into the most detailed X economy everOne of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.Research and teleportThe seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.",https://www.x4foundations.com,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 (64-bit)Processor: Intel Core i7-6700 or AMD equivalentMemory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GTX 1070 or AMD equivalent (Vulkan support required)Storage: 20 GB available space,['Egosoft'],['Egosoft'],"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'Steam Cloud']",,'total': 14503,"Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 (64-bit), Windows 8.1 (64-bit), Windows 7 SP1 (64-bit)Processor: Intel i5-4590 3.3GHz or AMD equivalentMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GTX 780/970 or AMD equivalent (Vulkan support required)Storage: 15 GB available space",True,False,True,False,"30 Nov, 2018",,,172,True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date.Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races.

The World of Total War: WARHAMMER IIMillennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent.Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex and great opportunity in its demise.Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured.

The Cycle: Frontier,868270,0,True,Free To Play,"DiscordFollow the link on the right to join.About the GameTHE CYCLE: FRONTIER WILL SHUT DOWN ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2023.Making this decision was very difficult for us, but ultimately it was a necessary one. You can find more information about this, as well as refunds, our final patch, and any questions you may have in the Steam announcement section.Youre a Prospector living aboard Prospect Station orbiting the dangerous alien planet known as Fortuna III. The powerful factions running the Station often send you on missions in search of resources and precious loot. Choose the gear and weapons best suited to your goals, pick your destination and within mere seconds youre dropping down onto the surface, ready for adventure. Be prepared for Prospectors like you out there, with their own goals and agenda. GREATER RISKS YIELD GREATER REWARDSWhich jobs to tackle and where to explore is entirely up to you but keep your guard up: Fortuna III is a dangerous place! Your goal is to survive and escape to the station with whatever loot youve managed to acquire, picked up from the ground or taken by force. The risks are yours to take. Falling prey to the planets dangers will see your body encased in protective foam, with your loot and equipped gear left behind but should you manage to escape, ka-ching! Other players will also be wandering each of the three available maps. They have their own agendas and are likely armed to the teeth. Fights are tough and can end quickly, so be sure to trust your eyes and ears, use the terrain and pick your fights carefully sometimes its best to talk your way out of a sticky situation. Other players arent the only threat though, as packs of hostile aliens and a supercharged radioactive Storm try their best to bring your forays to a premature end. A WORLD OF TREACHEROUS BEAUTYThree locations are currently available in-game, each with their own rich environment, dangers, and secrets to discover. Bright Sands is where most Prospectors will earn their first stripes. Many abandoned human structures found there can be searched for crafting materials and other loot. The local fauna is aggressive but not quite as dangerous as in other locations. Crescent Falls is the largest map, with very diverse biomes ranging from desert to jungle. The wildlife is considerably more dangerous, but the valuable loot makes it all worthwhile. This is also where higher level missions happen, which include calling a giant laser drill for big profit and, for the dungeon-delvers among you, exploring the Crusher Caverns. Tharis Island is the newest map introduced with Season 2. Its a small remote island host to labyrinthian cave systems, full of secrets, highly valuable materials and, of course, highly dangerous wildlife. Expeditions to the island are no walk in the park and players will have to gain experience first and unlock access through the faction campaigns. The depths of Tharis Island offer the most tense and challenging version of The Cycle: Frontier yet the highest risks for the highest rewards! PROSPECTING ISN'T EVERYTHINGWhether in an escape shuttle with a backpack full of riches or covered in foam and bare of your belongings, each trip to the surface will see you back home Prospect Station. This is where all that precious loot can be put to good use: buying and crafting better gear and upgrading your private quarters. New jobs and missions from the three factions are also available. The more of those you complete, the higher your faction levels, giving you access to better gear. Special faction campaigns are a great way to learn more about the world of The Cycle: Frontier especially after a significant expansion in Season 2. In addition to the standard issue Co-Tec weapons, you can unlock more powerful gear from the faction arsenal over time, all the way to legendary weapons like the infamous Zeus Beam. You can further modify weapons with a variety of attachments to fit your needs and play style. These range from a simple flashlight, to expanded magazines, armor penetration mods and more. Finally, a new way to add powerful perks to your weapons and equipment lies buried in the depths of Tharis Island, waiting to be discovered!WHAT'S NEW IN SEASON 3?The latest season for The Cycle: Frontier comes with an array of changes and additions. Keep an eye on the skies as the monstrous Howler makes a landing on Fortuna III and steel yourself for a tough fight as the factions ask you to face the new threat head-on and explore their nests. Wander the streets of an updated Prospect Station and fill your arsenal with a collection of Mk 2 weapons. Finally, advance your prospecting career in an environment where every choice and action matters in the long run. After all, mandatory wipes are a thing of the past!FEATURESChallenging, high stakes PvP encounters Tense extraction gameplay players lose loot and gear on death, but keep all loot on successful extraction Three unique playable maps to explore Play solo, as a duo or in a squad of three Near-instant matchmaking thanks to persistent map instances Multi-faceted progression system Elaborate gear customization system Deep material and crafting system Season pass with free and premium levels (Fortuna Pass) In-match Voice chat Cross-play between Steam and Epic Games Store ",https://thecycle.game/,Recommended:OS: Windows 10 64-bitProcessor: Intel i5-6600 or AMD Ryzen 5 1400Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon RX 570; 4GB VRAMDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 37 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Target framerate for recommended requirements: 60FPS,['YAGER'],['YAGER'],"['Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'In-App Purchases']",,'total': 331,Minimum:OS: Windows 10 64-bitProcessor: Intel i5-4590 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200Memory: 6 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD Radeon R9 270; 2GB VRAMDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 37 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Target framerate for minimum requirements: 30FPS,True,False,False,False,"8 Jun, 2022",,,192,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The Isle,376210,0,False,"'currency': 'EUR', 'initial': 1999, 'final': 1999, 'discount_percent': 0, 'initial_formatted': '', 'final_formatted': '19,99'","The Isle: A World Designed to Kill YouThe Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors.Massive Prehistoric MultiplayerBecome the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature.Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise.Survival or Sandbox?The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge.A Global Community StoryThe Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline.Future Development GoalsWe realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include:Playable aquatic and aerial creaturesEven more playable dinosaurs with complete life cyclesTwo new playable factions: modern humans & the indigenousEvolve into advanced ""strain"" versions of certain dinosaursRealistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behavioursAdditional world biome types such as thick junglesDynamic aerial drop-in spawn systemGlobal in-game world questLocalization of all in-game menus & textBetter accessibility & customization optionsSteam Achievements, Trading Cards, EmotesMod support using Steam WorkshopAll that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received----End Promotional Protocol----SiGnaL InTeRrUpt---tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev-",https://survivetheisle.com,"Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 64-bit or later (64 Bit ONLY)Processor: Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 3.4 GHz or faster.Memory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070DirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 25 GB available space",['Afterthought LLC'],['Afterthought LLC'],"['Multi-player', 'MMO', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Valve Anti-Cheat enabled']",,'total': 63174,"Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 64-bit or later (64 Bit ONLY)Processor: Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 3.0 GHz or faster.Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or AMD Radeon R9 280X series card or higher.DirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 25 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: This game needs a dedicated graphics card to run.

Conquer territories and fly your colors!A struggle for land where new strategies are born: from points to planes!The vast land of China is represented a single realistic map, with the characteristics of the land replicated beautifully in CG. The vast map is comprised of 46 cities and approximately 340 regions. The regions are collections of detailed territories, and the struggle for land is intuitively expressed through a color scheme. Players can conquer territories to unite the land and fly their colors more elaborately and more freely.New strategies created by supply lines and maintaining the front lineWhen troops are on the march, and the march origin city is connected to land controlled by the players forces, the supply lines will be maintained and troops can battle with ample supplies provided to them. However, if the connection with the march origin city is cut, the troops will lose their supply lines and will be weakened and fall into a disorderly state. Securing the supply lines is an integral part in maintaining the battle front.Administration changes completely by doctrine and a unique policy!Players can organize the administration, the center of power, as an element that expands the player's strategy. Administration is shown in an organization chart, and as retained officers are added to the organization, various commands and effects are obtained. It is important to make administration that suits your own strategy.More than 150 characters and over 1,000 officers the most in the series!More than 1,000 unique officers, which is the largest in the series, are in the game, and each officer is given a character (trait). There are more than 150 characters, with some being useful in battle, some in administration and so on. Some officers possess a powerful and unique character, and arranging the right officer in the right place will help in shortening the path to conquering territories.Note: The ""ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV: Diplomacy and Strategy Expansion Pack Bundle"", which is a set that includes the combined content of ""ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV"" and the ""ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV: Diplomacy and Strategy Expansion Pack"" is also available for purchase.

We know storage management is not something a lot of people like in general but the whole system is custom made and with autos available to help you keep everything neat and tidy.The Farmer has a very particular set of skillsSkills that he has acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for Potatoes. And each and every one of his many Talents, are made for the sole purpose of ridding the world of all Potatoes. Even the non-combatant ones if possible, as they make one hell of a meal.The Talent tree is huge, with choices that can change your play-style significantly. And the best part is that they are not permanent, so you can experiment to your hearts desire. And everythings visible from the start: no fog of war type of tree, no hidden talents or are there?Besides the Daily Quests, Achievements and ChallengesThere are many other features that you can play with, including a mini-game that you can play on a regular basis to get various timed buffs for your Farmer. The idea is simple: whack all the potatoes that pop their ugly heads out of the johns. Why, you ask? Because being a Farmer is a full-time job and enemies are everywhere!A feature thats almost always present in all idle gamesThe Reincarnation system which Farmer Against Potatoes Idle also has.

And bonuses and daily missions help you unlock new card packs every day so it wont be long before you have a deck that is capable of competing with the very best. - Finely balanced: Theres less RNG in Shadowverse than other card games, making it supremely balanced: youll need to trust your judgement not your luck if you are to come out on top. And we make balance adjustments every month to make sure that no one card or deck type becomes too dominant. - New card expansions released regularly: New card expansions are added every three months to make sure the meta never gets stale. And every single expansion unleashes new deck-building strategies and battle tactics, and even new leader classes and game modes. Were in this for the long haul and we hope you will be too. - Beautiful art: All of the cards in Shadowverse feature fantastic art by some of Japans finest artists, and every single card is available as an animated version. Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline. - A great community: And last but not least, we have some amazing fans. Weve got memes, weve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game. Community tournaments and e-sports broadcasts take place every week, and there are a ton of deck-building resources online in case you get stuck.

In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the rulers time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?MAKE THE LAWEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.SHAPE YOUR SOCIETYIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: theres no turning back.WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICESSome of your decisions will seem small like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIESSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but dont forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.EXPLORE THE FROSTLANDWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your societys population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.PLAY ENDLESSLYFrostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game.

Like the Deluxe Edition, this includes both the game itself and the soundtrack. In addition, you get a digital art and lore book with a lot of background info about the game, its art and its creation, as well as our very first legendary item in the game, complete with a look of its own and a unique background story: Fangshire.About the GameBattle Brothers is a turn based tactical RPG which has you leading a mercenary company in a gritty, low-power, medieval fantasy world. You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat. Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world. Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries. Permadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead unless they return as the undead. All characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witch hunter or a drunkard disowned noble? Character development without a restrictive class-system. Each character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks. Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer. Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior. A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat. Three late game crises a war between noble houses, a greenskin invasion and an undead scourge add a looming threat. Two full hours of orchestral soundtrack. 70 Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards.Overhype Studios is an independent game developer studio from Hamburg, Germany.

It's up to you to survive as long as you can with the tools that you unlock throughout life, such as food or constructions. As time goes on, your health will decline increasingly faster until you'll eventually die. However, death merely marks a new beginning. With every generation, your chances at survival will increase, because progress in previous lives increases your instincts.Managing timeThroughout life, you'll have access to various jobs, constructions and explorations. Using the step-by-step queue system, you can plan exactly what you want to happen and the game will automatically follow your orders. When your queue is empty, the game pauses automatically, so you don't lose any of your precious time! This is a game about planning and strategizing, not a game about micro-management or clicking. However, if you prefer to play more real-time, you can prioritize anything over your queue at any time.SkillsEvery action uses one of many skills, such as Farming of Woodcutting. Every skill has two leveling types, Generation levels and Instinct levels. Generation levels increase more rapidly and provide a bigger benefit throughout life. Instinct levels increase at a slower pace, but persist through death, creating a permanent improvement for every following life. The combined effect of these levels directly affects how quickly you can perform actions that use these skills, allowing you to spend more of your time on other actions to increase your chances to survive!Story based progressionYou progress through the game with a story. Exploring the world allows you to discover new tools to improve your chances at survival. Unlike most incremental games, having a story also means the game includes no procedural content, and you're actually able to complete the game. That story features approximately 220 hours of unpaused content in the 11 chapters that are currently available in Early Access. During Early Access, that story will be expanded significantly, until the game contains between 20 and 25 chapters. When the story is finished entirely, the currently available new game plus feature will be further expanded to offer an option to continue playing after completing the game.Meta progressionEvery generation will have better chances at survival than the last. The longer you survive, the more those chances will increase! This cycle of life and death plays a fundamental part in the overall progression through the game. Death is inevitable, but never pointless!Understandable numbers, yet mathematically fluentAll progression within the game is carefully balanced to provide a consistent feeling of improvement, while numbers are tuned to remain understandable. Most bonuses compound, which keeps your progression consistent and meaningful, without requiring overly complicated mechanics. So you can focus on what matters most, survival!Play the first chapter for free with the demoLike many things in life, you can only truly judge whether something fits your liking by trying it first hand. For that reason, Increlution features a free demo so you don't have to take anyone's word for it! Try it yourself, and only join Early Access if you're completely convinced that it'll be worth your while! Progress made in the demo will automatically be synchronized to the full version through Steam Cloud, so you wont lose any of your progress!

You can also join the conversation on:Official DiscordTwitter@cultivationsimAbout the GameIn a world of myth and magic, those who aspire to immortality devote their lives to the sacred path of cultivation. They gather around sects, institutions which train their bodies, minds and souls to be worth eternal life. But in return for such great power, you must be willing to guard the balance between good and evil -- no matter the cost.Unfortunately, greed is inherent to human nature, so it also blinds cultivators. Your master didnt realize until it was too late, and the Taiyi Sect burnt to the ground for his mistake. Your brothers and sisters will never come back, but the Taiyi Sect can still be reborn from its ashes. Its seeds are scattered around Tiancang, waiting for you to find them. This is what your grandmaster would have wanted. You must do it for him and for all those we sworn to protect.Set in the fictional Tiancang era, Amazing Cultivation Simulator brings to you the magic of Asian mythology through a strategy game with strong xianxia nuances, a Chinese literary genre which is deeply influenced by Taoist and Buddhist concepts, as well as folklore and traditional knowledge on medicine and martial arts. Its gameplay is inspired by famous games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress, as well as The Legend of Shushan Swordsman and Martial Kingdoms.As a grandmaster, youll bring the Taiyi Sect back to its glory days by training new apprentices, gathering knowledge and expand your domain through commerce and political alliances to gain influence over other sects.

Upgrade production buildings to increase efficiency and enable production of more advanced items.Most Detailed Farming System Ever - Strategically select from 10 crops with unique growing characteristics and configure crop rotations to maintain soil fertility, avoid heat and frost damage, and prevent the accumulation of diseases. Cultivate your fields over time, removing weeds and rocks, raising fertility and adjusting soil mixture to achieve maximum crop production to keep your growing population fed.Advanced Town Simulation - Villagers actively live their lives and perform their jobs in real time. Watch as villagers carry goods across town from remote work-sites to be processed into materials and crafted into items. See foods and goods delivered to homes, the trade post or stored for later use. Develop roads, transport wagons and improve storage methods to facilitate the efficient movement of goods through your town and prevent spoilage.Randomly Generated Maps - Farthest Frontier is highly replayable and no game is ever quite the same with beautiful, completely randomized terrain generation and resource distribution. Controls allow players to specify the amount of water or mountains they desire, with extreme maps leading to unique challenges.Idyllic to Brutal - Customizable difficulty options allow players to turn off features like invaders and disease, for a more tranquil experience or max out difficulty to truly test their town-builder prowess.Environmental Interaction - Develop your economy based on which resources are locally abundant and produce items for trade to acquire that which you lack. Erect fencing to keep deer away from crop fields and stop bears from raiding food storage. Manage tree cover to prevent underground water supplies from drying up. Balance the need to clear land for agriculture around vital natural resources like wild growing medicinal plants and forage items.All Them Old-Timey Diseases! - Ensure your villagers have clean water to stop outbreaks of dysentery and cholera. Collect berries and plant greens to avoid scurvy and ensure a healthy diet. Make sure villagers are properly shoed and clothed to reduce chances of contracting tetanus, rabies or frostbite. Build a healers house to quarantine the infected and provide herbs and medicine for treatment. Manage rodent populations by collecting waste, securely storing food and employing rat catchers to ward off the feared bubonic plague.Fend Off Would-Be Invaders - Choose to play on pacifist and avoid combat altogether or engage with varying levels of raider difficulty to raise the stakes for your towns survival. Progress from wood palisades to stone walls, build towers and barracks, recruit and equip soldiers in the defense of your town as rising prosperity attracts the attention of raiders and foreign armies seeking plunder.Crate Entertainment is a fully independent developer and publisher located outside Boston, MA.

Not Windows 7 or Windows 8. Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported!- OVR Toolkit requires you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account.- Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!)Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase!OverviewOVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type.Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease!OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip)Features Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.) Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you. Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you. Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world. Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!) Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them. Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click. Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!) Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage. Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch! Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings! Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly! Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too) Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification. Macros: Create macro keybinds which can be activated by a click on the wrist to trigger a series of key presses. (Such as changing OBS scenes, muting/un-muting Discord, etc.) Paste to Game: Clicking the Paste button found under the keyboard will automatically tab in the currently running game and push Ctrl and V. (Can be used to paste links into VRChat video players, paste join codes into codes, etc.) Customization Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI. Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI. Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications. Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!) Custom Apps allow web developers to integrate web apps into OVR Toolkit, allowing for integrated Twitch chat and games to be made.Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit. In this mode, you can interact with windows using head gaze, and use keyboard binds to move windows around you and change their settings. This mode is perfect for those intending to use OVR Toolkit at a desk or whilst in a sim racing/driving/piloting game!(This mode is still a work in progress, provide feedback in the OVR Toolkit Discord!) Move windows with keyboard binds when you have no controllers connected. Control your cursor position with your head using head-gaze input. Pin windows around you in your play space to view whilst in games. (Race overlays, etc.) Quickly toggle open windows with the 'Edit Mode' bind to show/hide some applications such as Discord, web browsers, etc. whilst in games. Voice Attack ready. (All controls are easily repeatable with the same keyboard key presses to support Voice Attack) Bindable voice input key using Google Speech to type out a sentence into a text box you have selected.Important stuff you should know aboutWe've tried our best to make OVR Toolkit support everything, but that just isn't how this world works!Please take these compatibility notes in mind before purchasing: OVR Toolkit requires being launched as admin, this is due to the inability to capture programs that are running as admin without running OVR Toolkit as admin, so it's needless to say a Windows account with admin privileges is needed. (If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you) OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10 and 11. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10) Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki! Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard) Oculus users, refer to the OVR Toolkit wiki 'Oculus' page for how to make OVR Toolkit appear in your games! We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!) Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix! Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering. Please try performance with your games running through SteamVR before you purchase OVR Toolkit. (Most noticeable effects with Flight Simulator 2020) If you have any issues with the application or find other compatibility issues, don't hesitate to contact us!

The second is Free Roam, which allows the player to instantly spawn as an adult with a fixed number of talent points. Death has little consequence, as there are no growth mechanics, or other mechanics that reward the player for staying alive.The third game mode is Combat.

Monsters beyond your imagination, and you: The Manager. A roguelite monster-management simulation inspired by the likes of the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Order your employees to perform work with the creatures and watch as it unfolds; harness greater energy, and expand the facility. One disaster will lead to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.Lobotomy Corporation is a roguelite monster-management simulation.Our game was inspired by the monsters birthed of various inspirations featured in games, film, and series, such as the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Going further, it was developed with this thought: What if those monsters were real, and your job were to manage them?You will be playing as the Manager of Lobotomy Corporation, a company in which such creatures are contained and managed. Order your employees to perform work with and on the creatures and watch the results expectantly. Gather energy produced by the monsters and fulfill the quota each day, expand the facility, and manage even more strange beings. In this game, the player will face an ever-present sense of tension and dread as they progress through each day.Our new technology will bring salvation to humanity.Lobotomy Corporation is a newly established energy company that isolates Abnormalities and extracts an infinite amount of energy from them by using independently developed technology, or so it seems on the outside. Join the corporation, and witness the true reality with your own eyes.Lobotomy Corp. consists of several departments, much like any other company. You will have access to various departments as you harness more energy. The more departments you have unlocked, the more efficient the management of Abnormalities will become.Furthermore, AIs such as Angela and the Sephirot will be at your side to provide all the assistance you need for smooth progression.Beings that you must constantly research and observe.We dubbed the creatures that reside in Lobotomy Corporation, Abnormalities.You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while extracting as much energy as possible from the Abnormalities. However, you must learn what types of work you should and shouldnt perform via trial and error.You start with zero information on the Abnormalities. At first, your eyes, ears, and the in-game manual will be your only hints. Let your intuition pick the work type that might suit the Abnormality best. After that, order the employee who is best suited for the job to work on the Abnormality, and wait for the results. In the process of managing Abnormalities, you will gain the power of information.The amount of energy you can acquire from Abnormalities will depend heavily on the type of work your employees perform.This is NOT a tycoon.As mentioned before, Abnormalities are beings that need to be treated with great care. Some might dislike the idea of being locked inside a Containment Unit, and may sometimes attempt to breach containment.A breaching Abnormality will attack every employee in sight and disrupt the facilitys systems. Worse still, it could open up other units and cause more Abnormalities to escape. Furthermore, employees eroded or corrupted by certain Abnormalities will have a greatly adverse influence on other employees. Employees brainwashed by Abnormalities might randomly attack those around them, wholly oblivious to what they are doing. In addition, employees may go insane from serious psychic trauma, disobeying your orders and damaging the psyche of other employees around them.One disaster leads to another, until everything has fallen into chaos.If you fail to resolve a situation immediately, it will ultimately spiral out of control and throw the whole facility into chaos. When such a situation does occur, you will have to gather employees to suppress any threat and regain control of the situation, or give up parts of the facility to ensure the companys safety.Tell me, manager. Do you have any wishes?The game consists of two main portions: Monster Management and visual Story Segments.Once a day of managing Abnormalities and producing energy ends, the story segment will follow right afterward.In the Story Segments, dialogue with Angela (the AI youll also be seeing occasionally in the management portion of the game) and the Sephirot will play. As you progress through the missions they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden deep in the company. You may have to ask questions, or answer questions from others.

PlanetSide 2,218230,0,True,Free To Play," PlanetSide 2 is a free-to-play, massively multiplayer online first person shooter (MMOFPS). Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.THREE WARRING EMPIRES Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.MASSIVE WARFARE Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.ENORMOUS MAPS PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings. PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS In PlanetSide 2 the war isnt won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.CLASS-BASED COMBATPlayers can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies cant with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.OUTFIT TEAMWORK Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization. VEHICLES & WEAPONSTrain and equip your soldier how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.PLAY FOR FREE ",http://www.planetside2.com/,Recommended:OS:64-bit Windows 7 or laterProcessor:Intel i5 6600K or higher / AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or higherGraphics:Nvidia GeForce 960 or higher / AMD R9 280X or higherMemory:8 GB RAMHard Drive:20 GB HD spaceDirectX:11.0Sound:DirectX compatible Sound Card Other Requirements:Broadband Internet connection,['Rogue Planet Games'],['Daybreak Game Company'],"['Multi-player', 'MMO', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Cloud']",,'total': 594,Minimum:OS: 64-bit Windows 7 or laterProcessor:: Core i5-4460 or betterGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 480 or betterMemory: 6 GB RAM (64-bit)Hard Drive: 20 GB HD spaceDirectX: 11.0Sound:DirectX compatible Sound Card Other Requirements:Broadband Internet connection,True,False,False,False,"20 Nov, 2012",84.0,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/planetside-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,446,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Idle Wizard,992070,0,True,Free To Play,"...Then try out Idle Wizard! It's an idle game infused with RPG elements, centered around becoming the most powerful wizard the world ever knew.The core aspect of Idle Wizard is choosing a Character Class. You start as an Apprentice, and are able to choose various Classes (12 total, with 6 powerful Hybrid classes later in the game), from classic fantasy-inspired sorceres to more unique magic-wielders. Classes use different mechanics to gain profit, are equipped with unique spells and items tailored for their use. While they're not unlocked all at once, all have use and range in power depending on your current progress and do not follow the simple logic of ""the later it is unlocked - the more powerful it is now"".Pets are a very important mechanic in Idle Wizard. All of them have a unique role and purpose, and most of the time it'll be beneficial to use more than more than one per run.Spells are paramount to your success (naturally!). After you get the hang of basics in the first few minutes, you gain your first spell-scroll and can start casting spells. Their mechanics differ greatly fro one another, from sheer profit or a buff, to meta-spells like speeding up time or boosting the xp of your pets! All the classes use a combination of common and unique ones, and sport quite a few possible combinations.Later in the game you can unlock and craft Items to help you profit even more - over a hundred total! Experiment with different item sets and loadouts to find the best one for the situation.Amount of available upgrades, achievements, and various more complex mechanics like Challenges, Trials, Catalysts and Expeditions allow for secondary goals and ways to boost you even more.

So we're excited about what's coming.ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE:In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.This War of Mine - main features:Inspired by real-life eventsControl your survivors and manage your shelterCraft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves anything that helps you surviveMake decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experienceRandomized world and characters every time you start a new gameCharcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's themeThe universe of This War of Mine has been expanded by following DLCs:The Little Ones - explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective - that of a child.This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition - this free DLC, created especially for the 2nd Anniversary of the game, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game.

Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic,784150,0,False,"'currency': 'EUR', 'initial': 2999, 'final': 2999, 'discount_percent': 0, 'initial_formatted': '', 'final_formatted': '29,99'","Manage all aspects of your own republic with planned economy, including mining resources, manufacturing goods, construction, investments, and citizens too.Create your own industrial complexes with loading and unloading stations, storage, warehouses, and factories.Build the infrastructure and manage its traffic, including roads, railways, sidewalks, conveyors, wiring, and pipelines. Wisely place and connect factories, houses and warehouses, and make the most efficient connections.Plan and build the living areas with everything your citizens may need to live their happy life, such as playgrounds, cinema s, taverns, and shops.Send your citizens to the mine to get coal, iron and other natural resources; or send them to the fields to pick up the crops; or take them to factories to produce manufactured goods.Sell and purchase resources and goods from western countries or other soviet countries to get dollars or rubles and buy the products or resources you need ... or invest in new infrastructure or buildings.Enjoy authentic soviet buildings and vehicles, as well as realistic landscapes of the 60's to the 90's.Play the way you want! You can focus on getting natural resources or products and trade them for money; or you can build a self-sufficient republic; or you can just use the easy sandbox mode with unlimited money/resources and just enjoy building something live.Economic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play one day you can sell or purchase steel for a 100 per ton, but in a few months the cost can rise to 200 or decrease to 50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources.Increasing difficulty.As prices change, the demands of the citizens also change, and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work.TRANSPORTATIONYou have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine, you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors, or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance. It is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But don't forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time, so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time.RESOURCES & INDUSTRYThere are, right now, over 30 commodities you can mine, transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric, then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them.Every commodity has a specific requirement,so if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks, while resources like wood, steel, or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes, food, etc. can be stored in warehouses.WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDSEvery worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you, they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food, but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat, clothes, alcohol or electronics. Also, to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time cinema, playgrounds, taverns, etc.Every worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher, or researcher, or work in factories with special requirements.ECONOMY SIMULATION The game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example, the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron, coal and work, and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction.You purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper.As time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.",http://sovietrepublic.net,,['3Division'],['3Division'],"['Single-player', 'Steam Workshop', 'Steam Cloud', 'Includes level editor']",,'total': 13052,"Minimum:OS: Windows 7 (64-bit), Windows 8 (64-bit), Windows 10 (64-bit)Processor: 2,5 GHz Dual CoreMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: DirectX 11 compatible gaming graphics card (2GB RAM or more).

Whether you play as the legendary general or against him, the outcome of war can never be guaranteed. The course of history relies on your ability to lead your troops through the most intense battles as never seen before in a Total War game.About The Peninsular CampaignThe Peninsular Campaign is an independent campaign based on the conflict in the Spanish Peninsula between 1811 and 1814. It was during this era that the Spanish resistance gave their style of fighting its name: Guerrilla, or the little war.Play the campaign from three different perspectives, each with a unique feel: The French fight to keep resistance at bay while converting regions to their political alignment. The British are very limited for regions at the start but receive enough income from Northern Europe and North America that they can afford to liberate regions back to the Spanish in return for Guerrilla aid. The Spanish also have a limited starting position but have permanent access to Guerrillas for effective battlefield use against the French. Choose one of the three nations involved - France, Great Britain or Spain - and experience one of the most intense conflicts of the Napoleonic era.Key Features: A new and independent Iberian Peninsula campaign map featuring 32 controllable regions. 5 new Guerrilla unit types, recruitable by all nations, adept at battlefield stealth and with the added ability to deploy outside of their faction's deployment zones: Tiradores (Skirmisher Infantry), Cazadores, Lanceros (Lancer Cavalry), Husares (Light Cavalry), Leader (General). 28 new units in total, spread across the three playable nations including the British 95th Rifles, the French Vistula Uhlans and the Spanish Coraceros Espanoles.

Icarus became a joke, a symbol of humanity reaching for the stars and failing. The xeno-engineers salvaged what they could, released modified embryos and halted the terraforming process. Yet when they discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these exotics sparked a gold rush and fueled political tensions back on Earth.Prospectors flocked to Icarus to complete contracts to extract exotics and conduct research for various factions. Those that survive return to orbit as seasoned veterans, converting their exotics into advanced technology, and taking on ever more challenging drops. Those that get left behind... are lost forever.---ICARUS is being made by a team of survival game veterans at RocketWerkz in beautiful Auckland, New Zealand.",https://SurviveIcarus.com,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 (64-bit versions)Processor: Intel i7-9700Memory: 32 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA RTX 3060tiDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 70 GB available space,['RocketWerkz'],['RocketWerkz'],"['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op']",,'total': 26740,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 (64-bit versions)Processor: Intel i5 8400Memory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GTX 1060 6GBDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 70 GB available space,True,False,False,False,"3 Dec, 2021",,,513,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Programming, however, is a huge obstacle that stands in your way. Coming up against such a challenge, perhaps most people have given up due to the difficulty involved.That becomes quite a loss for the entire game industry, because from among the ideas discarded, there's bound to be creations that could lead to huge, earth-shattering hits.The RPG Maker series was created to answer the wishes of all kinds of people who have found themselves saying, ""I want to make a game without learning programming,"" or ""Could anyone really make a game?""A Tool Designed to Make GamesRPG Maker is known in Japan as ""RPG Tsukru."" ""Tsukru"" is a coined term that, in a literal sense, combines the Japanese words for ""make"" and ""tool."" This signifies that RPG Maker is a tool that is designed to make games. Within RPG Maker, we have already programmed the basic operations that support RPGs. Making an RPG is as easy as putting in the stats for your heroes and villains, drawing up some maps, and using a simple eventing system to drive the story to it's finale!Create an Original Game with Ease!Included with RPG Maker MZ, we have prepared a wealth of resources consisting of the visual art and music that are needed to make games.

The Layer Function Returns!An incredibly missed feature from RPG Maker XP returns with MZ! Map layer control has returned. You can now select which of the four map layers you are drawing onto, or leave it on Automatic to keep the behavior from MV. This gives you more control to make your maps look the way you want to, as well as speeding up the map creation process: No more having to redo an entire tile because you messed up one layer or want to change the base layer!Shadow pen rectangle mode for wide-area manipulationHolding down the Shift key when selecting a shadow pen allows you to switch to rectangle mode, which manipulates a wide area.

The Highrise Demo,2175130,0,True,Free To Play,"The first alien beings did not fall from heaven. They come from beneath the ground.They destroyed everything on the earth on their first appearance.THE HIGHRISE is a first-person survival game set in a high-rise building that has been sealed off by an alien monster invasion. Gather resources to make fighting weapons and survival tools. You must find and send a rescue signal at the end of your desperate survival.Feel the void and abandoned highrise buildingPrior to this apocalyptic era, facilities such as shopping malls, offices, and residences, which were previously crowded with people, were very familiar and friendly spaces to us. But, now, they will inspire fear in a sense of emptiness and heterogeneity that no one can find. Furthermore, it is a space created by inspiring real skyscrapers, and the space that is vacated or omitted has been minimized. Players will feel that every floor and facility in the building will have the appearance of a very real space.SHHH! Beware of noise caused by carelessness.The monster sniffers responsible for humanity's extinction have a highly developed sense of hearing and smell. They can detect even the smallest movements, coughs, and gurgling sounds from your stomach. Moreover, if there is a loud noise, such as glass breaking or falling from a great height, the sniffers will rush to the player.GO DOWN AND DOWN! Find out more and better resources.To avoid the monster sniffers, the last survivor stayed near the top floor of a building. The player used to be a linker, connecting these survivors to the food court in the building's basement. Use this knowledge to your advantage. The lower floors you go, the more resources you have and the more efficient you are. However, as they get closer to the ground, the monsters become more powerful and the number of monsters increases. But you never know; you may find any hints to help you escape from the downstairs.KEY FEATURES Hunger and thirst must be controlled. However, be cautious of food poisoning. Food poisoning survivors are likely to be pursued by sniffers. You can obtain resources by destroying most of the building's furniture. For a much more efficient acquisition, use tools that are specific to the material of each piece of furniture. Make and install the tools required for survival. You can carry a still to purify dirty water, a cooktop to boil food, and a workbench to craft survival tools. You can avoid monsters by sneaking between them, but you can also create weapons to fight them. Crafting each appropriate tool and weapon for combat and infiltration allows you to work more efficiently. A ventilation system connects all of the building's floors and rooms. This is the only safe zone from the group of monsters, and it is entirely up to the player. Remember the layout and flow of this area.A total of six playable characters are available. Each has unique stats, passive skills, and a unique history. All characters can be unlocked by playing the game. In Demo, only one playable character will be available.There are single player and multiplayer modes for up to three players. The amount of resources available in multiplayer will be adjusted based on the number of players. In Demo, only Single Player will be available.There will be a sandbox mode and a survival mode available. In the sandbox mode, you will have infinite lives and get your resources back. However, in that survival mode, you can enjoy the high-rise game more concentrating with limited resources and only one life, so you can feel the true value of the game. In Demo, only Sandbox mode will be available.",,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 @3.20 GHz or higherGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 or betterDirectX: Version 11Storage: 5 GB available space,['Studio Hatch Co.

For more than 20 years, 3DMark has been the first choice for benchmarking, testing, and comparing PC performance.There'll always be a new game that demands more performance from your hardware. And there'll always be new hardware that delivers more performance for your games. And so the cycle continues. Welcome to 3DMark, the Gamer's Benchmark.3DMark includes everything gamers need to benchmark and compare PC performance. It has dedicated tests for all types of PC from lightweight laptops to dedicated desktops. 3DMark will recommend the best benchmark for your hardware.3DMark tests your system's GPU and CPU performance by rendering extremely demanding game-like scenes in real time. The faster the benchmark runs, the better your score. Now your quest begins. What can you do to get a better score?Start by comparing your 3DMark score with results from other systems with the same hardware. Lower than average scores may indicate a problem with cooling, configuration, or faulty components. Higher than average scores show the potential for overclocking your hardware. And if youre wondering what your 3DMark score means for real-world game performance, 3DMark also shows you the frame rates you can expect in a selection of popular games.Now see how much more performance you can get from your system. Update your drivers. Update Windows. Experiment with system settings. Run 3DMark after every change to track your progress. Identify bottlenecks in your system and compare 3DMark scores to help choose your next upgrade. Ask for advice, share tips, and show off your system in the 3DMark Community Hub on Steam.Overclocking is an art that takes skill and precision. The goal is to squeeze every drop of performance out of your GPU and CPU. The reward is a free performance upgrade and the satisfaction of pushing your hardware beyond its stock performance.3DMark is an essential tool for overclockers. Run 3DMark before and after overclocking to measure the performance gain. Use custom benchmark settings to explore your PC's performance limits. Make 3DMark tests more or less demanding by changing the resolution and other settings.Run 3DMark Stress Tests to check the stability of your overclocks and the effectiveness of your cooling. 3DMark Stress Tests run in a loop to put your system under heavy load for longer than a standard benchmark run.Challenge your friends to set the highest 3DMark score or compete for the top spot in the 3DMark Steam leaderboards.If you love PC gaming, there's nothing better than building your own custom PC. And if you build it yourself, there's nothing more nerve-racking than turning it on for the first time. Will it boot? Will everything work properly? Whether you're building a complete system from scratch or upgrading a component, 3DMark has you covered.Run 3DMark and compare your benchmark score with similar systems to make sure your new build is set up correctly. Detailed hardware monitoring charts show you how the CPU and GPU load, temperature, and clock speed changed during your benchmark runideal for identifying configuration issues.Use 3DMark Stress Tests to check the stability of your system and discover faulty hardware while it's still under warranty. Stress testing is also a great way to test and optimize your system's cooling performance. A well-built PC with decent cooling should be able to deliver peak performance for the full duration of a 3DMark Stress Test.3DMark can help when you are planning an upgrade as well. Search and compare benchmark results from all the latest graphics cards and processors on the 3DMark website to find the models that offer the best performance for your budget.PC gaming never stands still and neither does 3DMark.

There is also an ever growing selection of mods to suit your custom playstyle!Games of our Friendshttps://store.steampowered.com/app/342560/Airships_Conquer_the_Skies/https://store.steampowered.com/app/268650/From_the_Depths/About the GameSeveral hundred years ago, a cataclysmic catastrophe nearly ripped your galaxy apart - an impassable ring of torn hyperspace fabric appeared in the center of the galaxy, which normal hyperspace engines cant overcome.Since this Event nobody has managed to get near the central regions of the galaxy. All you know is that the Event also spawned multiple untraversable hyperspace rifts throughout the entire galaxy and that a strange race of aliens, the Xsotan, has appeared in the center. It looks like these aliens have found a way to cross over the torn hyperspace fabric, but so far nobody has managed to establish contact with them.There are also rumors about a strange new metal called Avorion which has appeared in the center of the galaxy around the same time as the Xsotan have arrived. Apparently, the aliens use this material to build their ships.Start out as a nobody at the edge and work your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more dangerous, but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core. Avorion takes sandbox aspects from games like X or Freelancer, throws in co-op multiplayer and lets you build your own ships. It features ships made of freely scalable blocks that can be procedurally generated and that break into pieces where they're hit in space fights.Equip your ship with chainguns, lasers and other weaponry to take on your enemies and enjoy the sight of completely destructible ships breaking at the exact points where you hit them. Defend your allies from pirates, hunt down enemies for coin or even participate in wars between entire factions. Once youre victorious, collect loot from defeated foes which you can use to upgrade your ship: new turrets with special abilities like autofire or repair beams, or system upgrades that allow you to install even more weapons. Build hangars and command squads of fighters in your battles or destroy enemy freighters to steal their cargo.Fly through beautiful nebulas and dense asteroid fields in search of hidden treasures and meet the many factions that populate and control their portion of the galaxy. Each faction has its own characteristics, such as peaceful, intelligent or aggressive, and its ships and stations have a distinct look.Explore the galaxy at your own pace to find valuable goods in old ship wrecks, undiscovered asteroid fields rich in resources, gigantic asteroids which you can claim for yourself, or clues about what happened during the Event a few centuries back.There are no limits to the size or complexity of your ship besides your resources. But there is also a creative mode where you can just build to your hearts content. You're not bound to the standard voxel style and while building an awesome ship in Avorion you won't get lost in lots and lots of micro-management. You can focus on building a great-looking ship, without having to worry about making it work. But always keep an eye on your ships maneuverability and energy requirements. Adjust your ship perfectly to its operational purpose: everything from light and agile explorers to heavily armored battleships with strong shields.And why build only one ship? Hire captains to fly your ships for you, manage your crews, weapons, hangars and fighters and build your own fleet of spaceships!Extend your ship with a cargo bay, find profitable deals and haul over a hundred trading goods across the galaxy to make a profit and buy your way up the food chain. Constructing a fleet of specialized transport ships with lots of cargo space will help you build up a trading corporation. Extend your influence in the galaxy by founding asteroid mines and factories that attract NPC traders who will buy and sell their goods at your establishments. Install trading systems that detect trading routes and supply and demand over multiple sectors and become the richest commander in the galaxy! Or maybe you're sick of being the good guy? Just raid freighters, smuggle illegal goods, or become a headhunter.You don't have to face all of these challenges alone! Avorion features co-op multiplayer, so team up with your friends to build stations together and destroy pirates and enemy factions! Everybody needs a copilot, and you can fly ships together, with one of you doing the steering and the other one taking care of firing weapons. Work with each other to extend your influence in the galaxy and build your own empire. Or, you know, blow your friends apart. It's a sandbox, you can do whatever you want!In Avorion you choose your personal playstyle. Haul cargo, find profitable trading routes and found factories. Or maybe you're sick of being the good guy? Build your own battleship, equip it with powerful weaponry and blow away your enemies. Be the aggressor that starts wars with entire factions, raid freighters, smuggle illegal goods and scavenge old wreckages.

Massive balls of pure magic obliterated nearly everything.

After many months of converting our graphics engine and beta testing, we are today announcing the final release of version 11.50 for the X-Plane desktop platform.Vulkan (PC) and Metal (Mac) are rendering level APIs that change how X-Plane interacts with the graphics card. They are faster than OpenGL that X-Plane has used in the past. Overall, most users will see improved frame rates and reduced stutters when using Vulkan or Metal.In X-Plane 11.50, there is a check-box in the graphics settings that enables Vulkan or Metal, and a restart of X-Plane is necessary for the change to take effect. If for some reason a user cant use Vulkan or Metal, OpenGL is still available by simply unchecking the box.Numerous bug fixes, enhancements, and new airports are also included in this release.BuzzNOW Available for a limited time only: ""X-Plane special bundle... including the Aerosoft CRJ-200 and Daytona Beach and Zurich airports from Aerosoft https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/10083/XPlane_11_Bundle_with_CRJ200_plus_Airports/X-Plane 11.32 ReleasedX-Plane 11.32 continues the evolution of the desktop version of X-Plane.

Idle Spiral,1827980,0,True,Free To Play," What's Idle Spiral? This is a beautiful ""Idle"", ""Incremental"" game based on spirals and mathematics. Your goal is to make the spiral grow longer and longer. The game is very simple, but it is very deep and can be enjoyed for a long time. How to play By buying upgrades, you can grow your spiral more efficiently. There will be a lot of mathematical equations, but don't be afraid. The upgrades themselves are not that strategic and you hardly need to understand this formula. However, as you continue to play, you will gradually come to understand the mechanics. Layered prestige mechanics The game has various reset mechanisms called Prestige (as seen in many Idle games!). Prestige resets much of the game's progression, but allow you to progress further and faster than before. Battle Spiral In Battle Spiral, your spiral is used as a weapon to fight various designs of spirals; to gain an advantage in Battle Spiral, it is important to consider what rewards to choose and in what order to fight the enemies. An extremely powerful boss with a very complex shape awaits you in the second half of the game! Challenges Challenges aim to achieve a specific goal under strong constraints. In challenges you will face debuffs, constraints, and fundamental gameplay changes while trying to achieve a certain goal. After reaching the goal, the challenge is completed and you receive big rewards. Endless Content Tornado Prestige is just the beginning of this game.

But now it's got a 2 on the end of it!Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be a Ranger. She could also be vegan. Its a new experience every time. Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until youre ready for greater challenges.Every Adventure is UniqueNew monsters, new traps, and new layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, and not memorization is the key to success.Wildly New ClassesNo two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger, and rain poisoned arrows down onto your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer and fly across the skies striking foes at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through your enemies, as the joyous bard, leaving only a trail of bodies behind you. Rogue Legacy 2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play. Brand New StyleWere taking a whole new artistic approach to Rogue Legacy 2. The sequel features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops. The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar RL look and feel.Revamped Biome GenerationWe went all-out with biome generation to make each area in RL2 feel completely new. Each biome adopts different build strategies to create completely unique yet-still-randomly-generated regions.True MetroidvaniaTo really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities that fully reveal the worlds secrets. These are not basic lock-in-key abilities, but powers that fundamentally change how you play. And heirlooms are not simply handed to you. You must prove your worth, provided you can find them.Traits 2.0Though fun the first time, the traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game. Weve now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges. The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward. This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time.Relics and ResolveOne of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played. Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom. But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes. Improved AccessibilityWeve taken accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules. Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections. You have complete control over how you want to play the game. Weve also introduced new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed.A Rich NarrativeNot only is the lore to the world of Rogue Legacy greatly expanded in the sequel, but it runs deep. New lore awaits you all the multiple NGs in. Beating the game once is only the beginning. Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible. And connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way.New Game+ for DaysYour journey has only begun after beating the final boss in RL2. There is a ton more to explore and discover on multiple playthroughs. You must choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights. The experience keeps changing for near infinite replayability.More of EverythingOf course were also adding more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy. More traits, more spells, more classes, more biomes, more enemies, more equipment, more rooms, more story. More secrets... Just more everything.Clownanthropy.Holy smokes! Punching clowns!AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE. This only scratches the surface of what Rogue Legacy 2 has to offer. Scar Challenges, Fairy Rooms, the Curio Shoppe, the list goes on, but reading is for nerds.

With deliberate, calculated and unforgiving gameplay, GROUND BRANCH aims to be the true rebirth of the tactical realism genre of the late '90s and early 2000s. Powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 4, GB puts the ""tactical"" back in ""tactical shooter""no compromises. TRUE FIRST PERSONGROUND BRANCH's unique True First-Person System improves world immersion and awareness of your surroundings, providing zero disconnect between your view and your character's physical presence in the environment. See your foot sticking out of cover? Better tuck it inenemies may be able to see it (and shoot it) too, but only if their line of sight and muzzle are verifiably unobstructed. Cameras are placed at the character's eyes and bullets originate from the weapon's muzzle. In GROUND BRANCH, what you see is what you get.A minimal HUD with multiple optional elements ensures that vital information is available, but never a constant obstacle to either immersion or your field of view. UNPRECEDENTED CUSTOMIZATIONSay goodbye to pre-defined kits and fully customize your character and gear from basic appearance and outfit to in-depth vest and weapon platform customization, down to individual pouch and attachment placement. What you bring to your mission is determined only by your loadout choice, with realistic consequences: With the upcoming encumbrance and stamina system, too much equipment will impact your character's speed and performance; place a scope too forward on the rail and your sight picture will be too small; bring a long rifle into CQB and weapon collision may prove a hindrance.Forget unlocks, microtransactions and loot boxes. Ground Branch operators get all the right tools for the job straight awaycourtesy of the Agency. OPERATE, COOPERATEWhether in 8-player co-op or 8v8 adversarial game modes, GROUND BRANCH's unforgiving gameplay makes careful and calculated teamwork essential. Gather your teammates and practice in full-featured training areas, including shooting ranges with dynamic targets and customizable killhouses. Integrated VOIP with both 3D positional voice and radio ensures full communication capabilities with no need for third-party software. Text chat and pre-recorded voice messages (commo rose-style) also available for the mic-less and the shy.Prefer single-player? Missions with friendly A.I. and a full command system are fully planned. BE IN FULL CONTROLIn the tactical shooter realm, movement and weapon handling are king. Take full control of your character with standing, crouching and (soon!) prone stanceseach with multiple movement speedsas well as unique weapon postures (including low- and high-ready), leaning and stepping out, free-look (head movement independent from aim), customizable and optional free-aim (dead zone), dedicated mouse sensitivity sliders for point-shooting/unmagnified/magnified aiming, and all-around highly configurable key bindings.You can also choose between speed reloads (drop magazine) and tactical reloads (retain current magazine) on the fly. ADDITIONAL FEATURES = FULLY or PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED = PLANNED/UPCOMINGMissions GROUND BRANCH's unique ""campaign"" format will deliver smaller, more localized sets of missions based around global hotspots, with a centralized intelligence interface to monitor them and receive new mission orders over time. The choices you make along the way may affect future engagements. Based on unique environments all over the world, the non-linear mission and map designs offer multiple entry points and open-ended outcomes. Enemies are spawned at mission start, with a degree of randomization to quantity and location. No ""monster closets"" or magic enemy spawns based on player location or mission progress.Multiplayer Ready Room: A physical multiplayer lobby where you can plan your approach, see your teammates' loadouts, test weapon configurations on a firing range and jointly select insertion points.

Map variation: In addition to day and night versions as well as weather variation, maps have small details that can change between rounds, such as doors and windows that may be open, closed or blocked. Unlimited loadout save slots. Item sharing/dropping/pickups. Accurate ballistics with penetration, bullet drop and stopping power simulation. No regenerating health or health packs: Administer first aid to non-lethal injuries for reduced combat effectiveness.

Specters hide among a group of good guys who need to root out the specters' true identities asap. The game has dozens of professions and maps, making for a diverse experience that never gets old. Plus there are fun modes like Battle Royale.How to PlayPlayers play as either specters or good guys and must determine who the killers are through behavior and speaking in meetings.Good guys must constantly watch over the actions of those around them. During meetings, they must clearly describe their whereabouts, who they suspect and why. But don't trust the words of others lightly, and don't make rash conclusions based on conjecture. If you're wrong, your team will be at a disadvantage. Clergy have a broader field of view and must use their skills to lead the good team to victory.Specters need to kill all of the good guys without getting caught. They can communicate with teammates with voice messages, use skills to cover each other, and kill good guys or create alibis among chaos. They need to lie about their whereabouts during meetings, accuse others or even pretend to be Clergy. Their goal is to interfere with the good team's judgment as much as possible.Player ObjectivesGood Faction 1. Complete all quests to achieve victory. 2. Vote out all specters during meetings to achieve victory. (Analyze the behavior and speech of other players to determine if they are good or bad. If you make the wrong choice, someone innocent may die because of it.)Specters Faction 1. Pretend to be good. Kill good guys when there are no eyewitnesses. 2.

Avenger: when sacrificed, will kill the target who voted him/her out. 4. Forensic Doctor: can see all corpses on the map. 5. Idiot: will not be killed the first time they are sacrificed, but can no longer vote or speak in meetings afterwards. 6. Psychic: at each meeting, learns which faction the dead belong to.Specter Professions: have the ability to assassinate and destroy by default. 1. Nightmare: can blind all players. 2.

The Hermit is a complete, fully fleshed out character, including everything you would expect from a Slay the Spire playable hero. Completely original character & card art, simple but elegant card design, a couple of new mechanics, unlocks, class-specific relics and potions - the full suite.As the Hermit, the positioning of cards in your hand matters - Dead On cards gain bonus effects while they are in the middle of your hand, so play or exhaust other cards first in order to get them into the center for maximum effect. Embrace the darker side of the Spire and be less afraid of curses, as they can be beneficial to you with the right loadout.Slay the Slayers - New Downfall Game ModeInstead of engaging in a Normal Run, you may now play in the alternate Downfall Mode, as one of seven Villain characters (with more to come!), and protect the spire from those who would harm it. Despite there being a large number of them, these Villain characters have just as large of card pools, relics, potions, and everything else you'd expect from a complete character. Villains host slightly more complex designs and fresh mechanics than the Standard run characters, making way for all new strategies in deck drafting and builds.Downfall Mode is separate game mode from the Standard run, traveling down the Spire's levels instead of up it. Encounter familiar events with theme-appropriate twists, collect and shatter the colored keys to protect the Heart's chamber, and harvest and feed Souls to the Heart to grow in power.The Slime BossCommand a squadron of Slime Minions to do your bidding as the dapper Slime Boss! Bash enemies head-first with powerful Tackle cards, which damage yourself as well as your foe. Coat your enemies in horrendous Goop and Consume it for bonus damage and healing, quickly restoring any Tackle damage that went unblocked.The GuardianAs the Guardian, waylay your enemies with powerful multi-hit attacks as you build up your Strength. Brace yourself, and shrug off the blows to enter Defensive Mode, easily deflecting damage and protecting your health while biting back with Thorns. Using the all-new Gem system exclusive to Guardian, collect Gem cards and socket them into other cards, effectively customizing your cards with bonus effects.The HexaghostUse the right types of cards at the right times to ignite the six fires that surround the Hexaghost for quick additional damage and other bonuses, using the all-new Ghostflame system exclusive to Hexaghost. Incinerate your enemies with Soulburn, and utilize Ethereal cards like never before with Afterlife, a new keyword that causes Ethereal cards to trigger their effects when exhausted.And Many More...Discover the other characters Downfall has to offer, each with their own new mechanics, some with even more unique and exclusive systems - and keep an eye out for future updates, because we're not done yet.Expansion content additions to Standard ModeLike all of the base game characters, the Villains each add a few Relics and Potions to the base game pool.A new suite of 'Boss' type cards have been added, themed around the Bosses of the Spire. These are generally high-cost, potent cards, and can be purchased at the Merchant, sometimes replacing Colorless cards.Additionally, a large collection of Events, Curses, Daily Run Modifiers, and Custom run modifiers are also a part of Downfall. The Daily Run system will randomly decide a character among all Heroes and Villains, and randomly choose if the run will be a Downfall run or a Standard run, for maximum chaos.All Villain characters can be enabled via the Config Menu to be playable in Standard Mode.

HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named ""Best PC Game Ever"" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide. NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in: Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ""muscles,"" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy. Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story and Monster's, Inc., creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.

Store your loot in a safe zone, or build a base in the vast world. You can store more loot in a base, and can't get offline raided. If other players kill you, you may drop a raid token which allows them to raid you for an hour. Mixed with tactical gunplay, challenging missions, newly-added boats, DEADSIDE offers an open world experience with fast and clear progression. You get guns fast. THE WORLD OF DEADSIDEThe world of DEADSIDE is vast and filled with forests, rivers, and settlements. You can build anywhere outside of settlements. Challenging NPCs patrol the map, and your progression is solely decided by your own skill. There are no levels or bars. Your level is your skill and the equipment you acquire.MISSIONSMissions are a crucial part of progression. The world map will have them conveniently marked. Watchout for armed military groups and bandits, and high tier loot. WEAPONS AND COMBAT SYSTEMIt's all about the ballistics and variety of weapons. Choose from 32 firearms, and modify them with scopes, expanded mags, flashlights, silencers and other modules. Feeling tactical? Setup tripwire traps, respawn beacons, use smoke grenades for cover. The combat system is designed to be hardcore.TRADE and SAFE ZONESStore your loot in Safe Zones. Nobody can take it from there. Trade with friendly NPCs. Make friends with other players. The Safe Zones are your extraction point if you don't want to build a base. CONSTRUCTION AND RAID SYSTEMThere are no offline raids in DEADSIDE! You can build your own base to store loot and have a convenient location to go out and do missions. If you die to other players, there's a chance of a RAID TOKEN spawning. The enemy can activate this token, and your base will be raidable for an hour. No more waking up to destroyed bases like in more standard survival PVP games.TRANSPORTATIONRight now, transportation in the game is represented by inflatable and swamp boats that occasionally appear in the game world with a small amount of fuel.Additional fuel and repair kits for the boats can be found while exploring the game world.As the game develops, we are planning to expand the number of transportation options.",http://deadsidegame.com,"Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10Processor: Core i5 / AMD Ryzen 5Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: GTX 1060 / RX 580DirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 25 GB available space",['Bad Pixel'],['Bad Pixel'],"['Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op']",,'total': 26544,"Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10Processor: Core i3 / AMD FXMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: GT 1030 / RX 550DirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 25 GB available space",True,False,False,False,"14 Apr, 2020",,,689,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The fortress works as an ancient nexus for different planes of existence. The depths are in an eternal turmoil as both old and new gods struggle for power, its up to the players to choose their position and stance in all of this.The game is a hybrid of survival horror and dungeon crawler genres with its influences ranging from Silent Hill to Nethack.

The game has drug and substance abuse, heavy themes ranging from self-mutilation to sexual violence. None of the themes are taken lightly however. They are all part of the world building and there to create the unique atmosphere where the game measures just how far the player is willing to go in order to survive.Parts of the dungeon layout, events, loot and enemy placements are randomized with few different variations to keep things fresh with subsequent playthroughs. The game is designed with the classic trial and error formula, so you can expect to start the game over and over again. But as long as you learn from your mistakes, you can quickly find yourself at the deeper levels of the dungeon.The combat in Fear & Hunger is turn-based akin to classic role-playing games, but with a twist of its own. You can target individual limbs of your enemies to dismember them strategically and thus maximize your chances for survival. However, just the same, enemies can also cut off the arms and the legs of your playable characters if you are not careful. You need to prepare well for every encounter if you wish to stay alive. But dont forget that running away from threats is often the best solution as well. There are many ways for survival in Fear & Hunger - You can find better equipment, learn different blood and love magic, fuse characters into each other, pray different gods, talk your way out of battles, meet new party members, snipe enemies from distance, use traps to disable them and so on.

Start with a small number of resources and expand into a long list of units and huge numbers.Infernal Contracts - Prestige Mechanics.A variety of locations: lab with energy crystals, junkyard, library with grimoire (containing dark spells).",,,['Aleksandr Golovkin'],['Aleksandr Golovkin'],"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'In-App Purchases', 'Steam Cloud']",,,"Minimum:OS: Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, or 10Processor: 2 GHz+Memory: 512 MB RAMGraphics: 128MBDirectX: Version 9.0cStorage: 50 MB available space",True,False,False,False,"2 Feb, 2023",,,696,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Make all the decisions necessary to take your team to the top: your responsibilities include recruitment, planning objectives and race programmes, sponsor management, scouting future talent, training, race strategy and much more. You can also create your own rider in Pro Cyclist mode. Join a team and prove you can be the leader, then do what it takes to shine in the peloton. Can you rise to become one of the best? Pro Cycling Manager 2022 lets you compete against players from around the world in online mode. WHAT'S NEW:New talent scouting systemA more energetic and attacking pelotonMore options for customising your game experienceAn easier-to-use interface (new Cyclist page)Redesigned stamina and resistance systemThe 21 official stages of the 2022 Tour de FranceNEW SCOUTING SYSTEMA good sport director must know how to recruit future talent, which is why we have set up a new scouting system. You have to send your scouts to different regions in order to uncover the best talent. Your scouts become more effective and improve over time. They regularly send you information (about potential, characteristics, etc.) which you use to make your choices (observation, integration in the development team, etc.) so you can learn more about the riders. You are, of course, in direct competition with the other teams. NEW GENERATION OF RIDERSThis new system is based on the level and potential of the young cyclists, using a 6-star grading system. Now the young riders who are created are juniors from 16 to 18 years old, with the pool comprised of 1,500 to 2,000 young cyclists each year (3 times more than before). These new riders will be more versatile and will develop similarly to the current stars. RIDER DEVELOPMENTJust like with the young talent, we want to have more versatile riders, so the development system has been redesigned to take this into account. It is also critical for your riders to perfectly integrate the team, establishing a good relationship with the coach, or they will not progress optimally.MORE VARIED RACEIn Pro Cycling Manager 2022, thanks to a more varied peloton, you experience scenarios that are different from the usual blueprint of a Tour stage, for example. You can find yourself in a race that is action-packed from the start, with favourites taking the lead, and a variety of attacks right from the first hour.OTHER IMPROVEMENTSThe interface has been redesigned, with a total overhaul of the cyclist page that now incorporates new statistics, highlighted rider capabilities and results, and the addition of an interface comparing cyclist characteristics. Stamina and resistance scores have a bigger effect on how effort is exerted during a race. This allows some riders to attack several times or manage their effort at the end of the race better.The race-day condition is now closer to the announced provisional condition. To enable comprehensive customisation, you can now adjust 2 parameters: bonus amplitude (from +5 to -5 or complete deactivation) and activation or deactivation of variation.The simulation time has been optimised and is now twice as fast as before. You can now have specific team jerseys for a given race.",,"Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 (64-bit)Processor: Intel Core i5-11600K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600XMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB or AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GBDirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 16 GB available space",['Cyanide Studio'],['Nacon'],"['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'Steam Cloud']",,'total': 385,"Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 (64-bit)Processor: Intel Core i3-540 or AMD Phenom II X4 940Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650, 1 GB or AMD Radeon HD 5770, 1 GBDirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 16 GB available space",True,False,False,False,"9 Jun, 2022",,,697,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Check out custom maps and download other modifications by the community.About the Game""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.""A tribute to the highly acclaimed film series in which the above quote originated from, No More Room in Hell (PC Gamer's Mod of the Year 2011, ModDB's Editor Choice Multiplayer Mod of the Year 2011), is a co-operative realistic first person survival horror modification for the Source Engine. Taking inspiration from George Romero's ""Of the Dead"" series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill.The chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation.Features:Teamwork: Co-operative play with up to eight players.Voice and Text Communications Limited by Distance: The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close!Dynamic Objective Maps: The next playthrough may not be the same as the last!Survival Mode: Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area.A Realistic Approach: In short, no crosshairs with limited ""only when you want it"" HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head!Multitude of Different Opponents: Ranging from the iconic ""walking zombie"" to the more contemporary ""runners"", NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead...Infection: One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure...30+ weapons and counting, ranging from the diminutive .22 Target Pistol, to the almighty Chainsaw.No ads (on official and community official servers, user-hosted servers may vary)No pay to win items or microtransactions100% Free (unless you buy the soundtrack DLC <3)No More Room in Hell is a Half-Life 2 Zombification.

It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria. How To Play The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. RolesTown of Salem has 33 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play. Before a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: www.blankmediagames.com/rolesGame PhasesNightThe night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity. DayThe day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial. DefenseThe defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows!Judgement During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging!CustomizationPlayers are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name. The other players in the game will see your selections. There are currently 10 maps, 29 characters, 20 pets, 5 death animations and 20 houses to choose from.AchievementsThere are currently over 220 unique achievements in the game.

Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.For the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unitys influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.The divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy.Take the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).Key features:New Factions: Decide whether to play as a Loyalist or Rebel each unlocks new technologies, ships and play styles for each race.New Titan Class Warships: Mighty titans enter the fray of the war to tip the scales of power.

Your ship's design is key to its survival, and every decision you make will impact its performance in battle. Easily share your designs with others through the Steam Workshop, Forums, and Discord.A ship's crew is its lifeblood.

Combat is physics-driven, explosive, and immensely satisfying. Each module can be individually targeted and destroyed, and whole ships can even break apart into multiple pieces. Target an enemy's weapons to eliminate its offensive capability, destroy its shields to lower its defenses, or go for the kill by taking out its reactor.Become the most famous ""Cosmoteer'' in the universe by battling A.I. ships, taking on contracts for factions, earning loot, and upgrading your own ship while exploring a procedurally-generated galaxy, alone or in online co-op with friends.

Enjoy every single scene in different atmospheres created by dynamic weather.Survive in This Vivid WorldRuthlessness is the true color of this world. In order to cope with extreme heat and severe coldness, you need to store as much food as possible and make clothing by gathering and hunting. You also need to master skills such as forging, weaving, carpentry and cooking. In some cases, threats from natural environment are far more brutal than those from enemies. Bear it in mind that the only way to win is to survive.Acquire and Combine Martial ArtsWanna fly over the wall, control swords and use inner strength? Try to find the concerning scrolls scattered everywhere in this world, including those dangerous caves and temples. With help of these skills, you can survive and explore in a better way, but it depends on you how to use and combine them.Create Martial Arts and Clans of Your OwnAlready mastered some martial arts and wanna establish your own clan? No problem! Use what you learnt to carry out various combinations based on the rules and enjoy a changeable combat experience!Utilize Weapons With WisdomHand-to-hand combat is inevitable, while bow and arrow are also necessary. You can wield melee weapons to show your strength, but your enemy can use long-range weapons to suppress you. You may be able to repel the opponent by throwing objects in the last second, however, you're likely to get into a trap set by the enemy while chasing him in the next second. Your choice is the most powerful weapon!Build Homes and Compete for TerritoriesNo matter how many achievements you've got, you will still need a shelter. Use your creativity to build your home from zero. Beware of monsters intending to invade and enemies trying to occupy your home. Wisely choose the construction site, set up traps, and protect your territory!Explore Ruins and Challenge BossesThere are many mysterious underground palaces hidden in this world, such as the Loulan ruins in the northwest and the military base in the southeast. Discover what happened to these sites, defeat bosses guarding there and find the buried treasures.",,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10Processor: Intel Core i7-10700AMD Ryzen 7 3700XMemory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 2060DirectX: Version 12Storage: 60 GB available space,[''],['(CubeGame)'],"['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'MMO', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer']",,'total': 435,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10Processor: Intel Core i5-7500AMD Ryzen 3 1300XMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060DirectX: Version 12Storage: 60 GB available space,True,False,False,False,"27 Apr, 2023",,,752,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

You have full control over the army composition. Based on your successes and reputation you might get access to more corps, divisions and brigades. Keep your soldiers alive and they will learn to fight better, turning from green rookies to crack veterans. Lose a lot of your soldiers and you might not have enough reinforcements to deliver victories. Your reputation will suffer, army morale will drop and you will be forced to resign.Innovative command system: You decide which level of control you want. Command every unit individually or just give them a main goal with one button click and watch if they can take that hill. Army divisions commanders can make decisions on their own and help you control the largest army. Draw a defensive line and allocated brigades will defend it like lions. Or design a deep flanking maneuver by just drawing an arrow and send the whole army to the enemy flank or the rear. Your generals will try to fulfill your orders, although ""no plan survives contact with the enemy"".Officer progression: Historical unit commanders progress and become better fighters together with the player. The Officers rank up based on their units performance, but it's war and they can be wounded or even get killed in action. New ranks open new possibilities and allow officers to lead bigger units without efficiency loss. Winning battles also opens new possibilities for you as a general, increasing skills such as reconnaissance or political influence.Historical weapons: There is huge variety of Civil War weaponry from mass produced Enfield pattern rifles to rare Whitworths. Historical availability has also been implemented. Certain weapons can only be captured by raiding supplies or taken from the enemy on the battlefield. Enhanced unit control: Detach skirmishers to send them to scout those hills ahead. Or merge several brigades into one bigger division if its needed. Dismount the cavalry to become less visible to the enemy or mount for fast flanking charges and supply raids. Supplies are extremely important and you have to plan and defend the provisions otherwise the battle might end for you early.Advanced Artificial Intelligence: You will face a strong enemy. AI will flank you, will hit your weak spots and undefended high ground, will chase and cut your supplies and will try to destroy unguarded artillery batteries. AI will use terrain and will take cover and retreat if overwhelmed. Terrain matters: Trenches, lines, fences, houses, fields everything can help to achieve victory, if you know how to use it. Hills will allow you to see enemy units earlier. Rivers and bridges can become natural obstacles that will help you to defend. Forests can help you hide your movements and flank the enemy. Beautiful maps: We believe that modern technology allows hardcore war-games to finally stop being brown on green hexes. Hardcore, deep war games can be beautiful. In our game, every historical battle landscape is accurately hand-drawn, utilizing data from satellite and historical maps. The topography plays immense strategic role and helps to understand how battles were fought and to learn history.",https://www.ultimategeneral.com/,"Recommended:OS: Windows 10 - 64 bitsProcessor: Intel i5Memory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: 1GB VRAM, 1920x1080 resolution, Nvidia 960 or Radeon R9 285DirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 2 GB available space",['Game-Labs'],['Game-Labs'],"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards']",,'total': 6846,"Minimum:OS: Windows 7 - 32 bitProcessor: Intel i3Memory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: 512Mb VRAM, Minimum 1366x768 resolution, Intel HD 4000 and higher, GeForce 8800 and higher, AMD Radeon X1600DirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 2 GB available space",True,True,False,False,"14 Jul, 2017",,,779,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

With the aliens' motives uncertain, factions emerge, driven by hope, fear, or greed.You will control one of these factions.The Resistance works to form an alliance of nations to mount a coordinated defenseHumanity First vows to exterminate the aliens alongside any who sympathize with themThe Servants worship the aliens and believe they will solve all the troubles of the worldThe Protectorate advocates negotiated surrender as the only means to avoid annihilationThe Academy hopes the alien arrival heralds the opportunity to form an interstellar allianceThe Initiative seeks to profit from the chaos and destructionProject Exodus plans to build a massive starship and flee the Solar SystemA distant anomaly, a mysterious crash site, and a spike in reported disappearances. Could this truly be humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial lifeforms? As your field agents investigate sightings and your scientists race to explore new fields of research, you will slowly learn the truth behind the alien arrival.From early sightings and UFO crash sites to rampaging alien megafauna and robotic armies, it will rapidly become clear that the other six human factions are not your sole competition. Throughout the game, illustrated events will present you with difficult choices as you investigate growing alien activity on Earth. Uncover the mystery of the aliens origins and motives unless, of course, you are Humanity First, and all that matters to you is extermination.Terra Invicta has a global research system that creates opportunities for both competition and cooperation. Shared scientific advancement unlocks private engineering projects. Factions can choose to focus on private projects, at the cost of weakening Earth as a whole and ceding influence over global research direction to other factions with different priorities. Left unchecked, factions like the Servants or the Initiative may steer the worlds efforts toward developing methods of social control, rather than propulsion or weapon systems.You begin on Earth as the head of a shadowy organization devoted to your chosen ideology. The aliens are coming soon but your first enemies (and perhaps allies) will be other human factions.Lead a faction united by ideology, rather than a nation defined by territory. This is a stark change from most strategy games in Terra Invicta, you will not paint the map with the colors of some chosen nation. Instead you will rule from the shadows and compete with other factions for control points representing a region's military, economic, and political leadership. Geopolitics is your sandbox unite or break apart nations as best serves your ends, while using those under your influence to conduct proxy wars against the other six factions. Earths regions are modeled in detail, from educational levels and unrest to GDP and inequality. Gaining command over regions with great monetary wealth and military power can allow you to implement your will on Earth, but the war for the Solar System will not be won without also securing regions containing space launch facilities.Enact your will through a council of politicians, scientists, and operatives sent around the world (and even into space). The starting abilities of these councilors will improve through gaining experience and acquiring control over powerful organizations like intelligence agencies or wealthy corporations. A veteran commander may make the perfect choice to lead a tactical team under the councils direction, while an experienced diplomat works to secure the funding needed to resist the alien invasion.Seek out like-minded populations and politicians and take actions to convert followers of opposing ideologies. Public opinion is modeled along multiple axes the Servants alien worship and the Protectorates advocacy of negotiated surrender may largely align in terms of support or opposition to the aliens, but events that show the aliens can be defeated have the potential to convince followers of the Protectorate that resistance is a realistic choice. Terra Invicta bridges the gap between our modern-day world and the vast interstellar empires of other space strategy games, asking you to take humanitys first steps in colonizing our Solar System, where over 300 asteroids, moons, and planets in constant motion create an ever-changing strategic map.Take your faction beyond the confines of Earth, building space stations to act as shipyards and fuel depots, constructing mining stations to acquire advanced resources, and establishing bases to serve as research or construction facilities. Terra Invicta zooms into the strategic geography of the Solar System, presenting space not as a series of isolated stars that you order units to move to and from, but rather a rich and varied landscape of asteroids, moons, dwarf planets, gas giants, and other celestial bodies creating texture and tactical opportunities at every turn.The expansive map is constantly shifting as celestial bodies orbit the Sun. This means your space stations and forward operating bases are constantly moving as well, forcing you to plan accordingly and adapt to the evolving circumstances your colonies among the Jovian moons could find that a once-distant alien military outpost or Initiative privateering base has suddenly become a close neighbor.Terra Invicta explores what might be how colonies on Mars might function, what plausible engines could power our spaceships, and the nature of how space colonization and warfare might proceed. Players may find themselves establishing a mining base on the asteroid 16 Psyche after noticing it is rich in metals and then learn that in our world NASA is planning The Psyche Mission for the same reason.Exploring and eventually colonizing space will require access to many resources: water for life support and propellant, metals for manufacturing, fissiles for nuclear drives and weapons, and more. At the start, youll have no choice but to acquire such resources on Earth and suffer the high cost of using rockets to escape Earths gravity, but over time youll increasingly choose to instead rely on asteroid mining and other means of securing local supply.Spaceship design in Terra Invicta draws from the best of scientific speculation and hard science fiction. You can design your own ships, selecting from an array of weapons, drives, and other modules to place on a variety of hulls, ensuring each ship has the right mix of fuel capacity, maneuverability, and other capabilities.Tactical combat is built around a realistic simulation of Newtonian physics, where momentum and maneuver in 3D space are just as important as the firepower your ships carry. Fire missiles and use point defense cannons to destroy incoming projectiles; build up momentum then swing hard to bring the enemy into your firing arcs; or grapple with the difficult decision to retract radiators and sacrifice heat dissipation to achieve better armor against an incoming enemy barrage.Terra Invicta is built with modding support in mind, and much of the game is accessible to modders without a coding background. We hope that the Solar System setting and geopolitics simulation will provide a useful framework for modders to realize their own creative visions.",https://www.pavonisinteractive.com/,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 Home 64 BitProcessor: Intel iCore i5-3570K / AMD Ryzen 5 2400GMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: 4GB VRAMDirectX: Version 12Storage: 25 GB available space,['Pavonis Interactive'],['Hooded Horse'],"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Workshop', 'Steam Cloud']",,'total': 4291,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 SP1 64 BitProcessor: Intel Core i3-2105 / AMD FX 4300Memory: 6 GB RAMGraphics: 2GB VRAMDirectX: Version 10Storage: 25 GB available space,True,False,False,False,"26 Sep, 2022",,,788,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for.Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with:64-player battles6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities:United States Army and Marine CorpsNorth Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong)Australian ArmyArmy of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and BushrangerAsymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppersMore than 20 maps3 distinct game-modesProximity VOIPAnd hundreds of character customization options.Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong).SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVNThe Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms:US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikesAustralian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artilleryARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 SkyraidersFor mobility, they have access to full helicopter support:UH-1 Huey: provides rapid transport for a squad across the mapOH-6 Loach: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its minigunsAH-1G Cobra: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officerAustralian Bushranger: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rocketsTactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments!As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time:M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 grease gun, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMGM14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper riflesM60 LMG and M16 automatic rifleFor heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrowerExplosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 ClaymoreNORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VCThe Northern forces offer a broader mix, with the Peoples Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has:PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trailNLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrageTo compete with the Southern forces mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth:NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the linesGiven their home field advantage, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover cant be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraftSA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it rightHo Chi Minh Trail ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his teams spawning rate, when times get desperateAmbush Spawn ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes.The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons:AK-47 and Type 56 Assault riflesRussian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifleMN 91/30 and SVD sniper riflesPPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGsIZh-58 double-barrelled shotgunDP-28 and RPD LMGsRPG-7 rocket launcherMD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps",https://rs2vietnam.com,"Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only)Processor: Intel Core i5 @ 3.2GHz or AMD @ 4.0GHz or betterMemory: 6 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X or betterDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 60 GB available space","['Antimatter Games', 'Tripwire Interactive']",['Tripwire Interactive'],"['Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'In-App Purchases', 'Stats', 'Includes level editor']",,'total': 37112,"Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only)Processor: Intel Core i3 @ 2.5GHz or AMD Phenom @ 2.5GHzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or ATI Radeon HD 5850DirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 60 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE: 32-bit Operating Systems",True,False,False,False,"30 May, 2017",81.0,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,789,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game.Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just dont spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what cant be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.You dont need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here.Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted.Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and arent that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when its less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You cant sell what you dont have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really dont want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel.We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isnt your cup of tea, we dont force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.Key FeaturesRenovate, run and expand a gas station in the desert.Build new services like a workshop, shop, warehouse or car wash.Try to handle everything on your own or hire employees to help out.Interesting events on top of the normal gameplay.Lots of customisation and decoration options.Lots of different customers with varying needs and expectations.Lots of management options for you to dive into.https://store.steampowered.com/app/1528080/Gas_Station_Simulator_Prologue__Early_Days/",,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 11 64-bitProcessor: Intel Core i5 (recent generation)Memory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: NVidia GeForce GTX 1070 or better 6GB VRAMDirectX: Version 12Storage: 15 GB available space,['DRAGO entertainment'],"['DRAGO entertainment', 'Movie Games S.A.', 'HeartBeat Games']","['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Cloud']",,'total': 16763,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 64-bitProcessor: Intel Core i3 3.0 GHz or Ryzen 3xxxMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 4GB VRAMDirectX: Version 11Storage: 10 GB available space,True,True,False,False,"15 Sep, 2021",72.0,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/gas-station-simulator?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,805,True,False,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls ""Mr. Riggs"", can withstand the harshest environmental conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.BASE BUILDINGYour task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission.DEFENSEYour presence on this planet will not go unnoticed. As you build up your industry and disrupt the natural order, the world will start seeing you as a threat. Build up your defenses. Construct walls, barriers and defense towers as the attacks get stronger with every passing day. You will face thousands of hostile creatures trying to eliminate your presence.EXPLORATIONGalatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using rift technology.CAMPAIGNTake on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. Youre the only human there, after all.SURVIVALYour mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability.SANDBOXIf intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions.CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAYThe Riftbreakers gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.COMMUNITY DRIVEN DEVELOPMENTIf you've read everything and arrived all the way down here, then you might be interested in helping us shape the game.

In PVE mode, players must cultivate immortals cooperatively because they are not allowed to invade other factions. But in PVP mode, you can invade other players factions and plunder their resources, putting everyone against one another. This mode is full of challenges, and it will conclude at the end of the battle season. When you wake up in the Four Quadrant Array, you realize you are in a chaotic land full of fantastic creatures and merciless monsters. You are bare-handed and defenseless. In order to survive in this mystery land, you must learn how to build tools, acquire resources, and make equipment and goods. One person isnt enough work together with your friends to build your own faction and make it stronger or join other factions if you like. Forge some powerful weapons to hunt those ancient creatures and monsters, explore this wide and mysterious land, find the truth behind it, and make your own stories. Labyrinth Territory Labyrinth territories are dangerous places with full of random puzzles and mysterious creatures. You can hunt mysterious creatures and find treasure boxes to obtain rare materials for forging equipment. Cooking systems can help you cook food to increase your strength, and the plant materials you collect on the ground can be refined to make useful medicine. Remember to use the Arcane Altar when you beat a level in the labyrinth territory. Players can get random abilities to become more and more powerful - sooner or later they will be strong enough to challenge the Lord of Labyrinth. These abilities are too powerful to control so they can only be used in this territory. Be very careful, as some undead left their belongings in this territory. If you are scared and in danger, remember to use the teleport stones to escape.To SurviveFood and water are essential for survival. There are many different kinds of food in this land, all with different effects when eaten. Consuming uncertain food may bring negative effects, so be careful. All actions consume water and food, and long-distance travel will consume those items continually. There are many factors to determine how you can survive in this world, but day and night cycles and weather conditions are some of the most important. Make sure to make some suitable clothing, expand and enhance your factions, build shelters, and use fire to protect yourself from the harsh and changing environment. Create Factions Logging, Mining, Collecting, Hunting, and Becoming a Master. Use your crafting abilities, worktable, forging table, grinding table, handiwork shelf, and other tools to improve your skills and create more complex and powerful items to fight against enemies and protect yourself. Use the construction hammer to build your base and improve your base functions. Use everything you can to make the greatest and strongest faction possible.Battle SystemYou can choose your weapons from more than 10 different weapon types, in addition to countless types of equipment to protect you from head to toes. Besides physical weapons, magic instruments and magic stones can cast elemental attacks. Use each attack method and enjoy the fun and dynamic battle system. To explore the world, walking is not the only option: you can dodge, stand on your sword to fly, run on the water, swim, and even feign death. These skills can help you gather materials more efficiently and help you fight those formidable monsters. Master the real fighting arts - increase your stamina, magic power, dodge, parry, and counterattack and become the greatest warrior in this land. Guild SystemWhen people gather together, there may be some conflict. As a Guild Master, you need to manage your faction well. Unite each member, work together, and conquer the mysterious ancient world. Oh, almost forgot - before that, make sure to give your faction a cool name.",,Recommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 64 bitProcessor: Intel Quad Core i7 3770K or AMD Ryzen 5 1600XMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: nVidia GeForce RTX 2060 (High settings) or AMD RX5700 (High settings)DirectX: Version 11Storage: 30 GB available space,['Ac Games'],['Ac Games'],"['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'In-App Purchases', 'Partial Controller Support']",,'total': 12345,Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10 64 BitProcessor: Intel Quad Core i5-2300 or AMD FX-6300Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960(4GB) or AMD Radeon R9 380 (4GB)DirectX: Version 11Storage: 30 GB available space,True,False,False,False,"14 Apr, 2022",,,813,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Limit Bursts are flashy abilities that can swing the tide of battle. Assigning multiple Heroes with the same Limit Burst to your party increases the Limit Burst's strength, which adds another layer of strategy to party building. Both skills and Limit Bursts can be activated with a few quick clicks, letting you focus on timing.-Tell me more about upgrading Heroes.WHERE TO BEGIN. You can level them up, of course. You can upgrade their star rating by collecting their souls. You can attach orbs to upgrade certain stats. You can equip them with gear to give them extra abilities. Gear can also be upgraded separately, by the way. Certain Heroes can also be """"awakened"""", which grants them new passive skills. Basically, you take your parties from lil' babby weaklings to powerhouses that can take down literal gods. Their power scores get bigger, and you feel better.-Connect Battles... What are those about?They're co-op battles that you can run in real time with your friends. The bosses in these battles are big. Real big.

Control a variety of warrior ant species in intense battles, command your workers to build and supply an ever-expanding base, and protect your queen at all costs while navigating the unique threats and opportunities of the insect world.Hundreds of warriors clash in a melee of gnashing mandibles as formic acid artillery fires overhead. Nightfall has come and the last of the workers are rushing back underground, dodging beetles to deliver food to the nest. The stockpile is empty, and without more, reinforcements will not hatch for the ongoing war between the duelling Empires of the Undergrowth.Starting from a central room hosting your queen, order your workers to develop and optimise your nest a vast network of store rooms, nurseries, and hallways. Dig through a hex-based maze of soil and bedrock, seeking food and fending off other underground dwellers.Push beyond the confines of your nest to see what the world above has to offer with seeds, nectar, fungus, other insects, and even amphibians on the menu, there's plenty to choose from, but each food source comes with its own strategic tradeoffs and challenges. Will you venture forth and fight off the ladybugs that eat and deplete your source of renewable honeydew drops, or do the surrounding nocturnal creatures present too much of a risk for your fledgling colony? Each decision you make has a ripple effect that can doom your colony if you arent quick to react to evolving circumstances.Manage a multitude of species with different attack patterns, natural weapons, and evolutionary paths to tackle the particular dangers of your current biome. Nighttime sorties are at times essential as you look to secure food supplies, though unsuspecting ants might fall prey to the dangers that lurk after sundown. Come morning, youll find yourself competing with other ant colonies instead, entering enemy nests to attack their queens while defending your own. Prepare to operate and coordinate simultaneous war efforts across multiple underground and overground maps as your threats and opportunities change with each passing moment theres no single path to domination.Workers scurry in from the surface. Few have returned, but they carry valuable sources of food that will help reinforce the front as a new wave of warriors pour forth from the nurseries, eagerly following the scent of pheromones that tell them where to go and what to do en route. They are the last bastion of the colony, born with a singular purpose hold the line!Design and organise multiple nurseries and assign them individual pheromone groups, with each pheromone group taking orders through the placement of pheromone markers, adjustable rules of engagement, and context. Learning to navigate the behaviours of your ants, as well as each species strengths and weaknesses, is integral to securing success.Each pheromone group can be specialised on the fly, told to exclusively collect food, partake in combat, or do both the right decision can turn the tide of battle. In desperate times, when the colony is starving and new eggs have stopped hatching as a result, will your warrior caste focus on gathering food at the risk of being picked off by aggressive enemies en route? Or will the soldiers divide into escort groups for your remaining workers, ensuring survivability at the cost of overall efficiency elsewhere? Dont forget to keep at least some workers at the nest to dig, build, and maintain the placement of eggs, to ensure the survival of your ant economy.Each species of ant presents its own set of strengths and weaknesses on the battlefield. In special game modes where multiple species can be raised in the same colony, your decision to raise and upgrade one or the other will completely change the way you do battle. Trap-jaw ants fight in melee, occasionally leaping back to replenish lost hitpoints. Leafcutter majors fulfil their natural role as protectors by drawing enemy aggression onto themselves to give allied ants an opportunity to flank, regroup, or escape. Wood ants can evolve to fire formic acid as long range artillery or in a more rapid, straight line. Find synergies between the multitude of natural strengths and weaknesses of each species, and prepare to defend against them when warring with rival colonies.Your enemies are equally varied apart from other ant colonies, youll engage in combat against arachnids, amphibians, crustaceans, and a wide variety of insect species. These powerful and often (comparatively) gigantic creatures present a unique threat to an unprepared colony, and only superior tactics can overcome them. An envelopment manoeuvre can circumvent the adult devils coach horse beetle's stunning spray, while tactically isolating and overwhelming hermit crabs one by one will bring their demise faster than they can hunker down to heal.Victory is certain! Reinforcing troops arrive in the nick of time, fearless in the face of the horrifying abomination before them. Today the sadistic scientist has blended hermit crabs with scorpions into a terrifying new threat, but the colony has evolved wisely after experiencing such unnatural foes before. After a protracted battle the fearsome chimaera teeters on the brink of collapse, but a new foe arrives on the battlefield piercing through the skies above, the hand of some strange being comes down to crush half the reinforcing troops, and from the great beyond the scientist lets forth an evil cackle.

Naval Action,311310,0,True,Free To Play,"Naval Action is a hardcore, realistic, and beautifully detailed naval combat game immersing players into the experience of the most beautiful period of naval history - when sailing ships ruled the seas. No game has come closer to the replication of the Age of Sail sailing mechanics and combat. Naval action was named one of the best releases from early access in 2019 by Steam and Steam community.Here is what you can expect:Beautiful ships We have been painstakingly recreating the beautiful ships of the Age of sail period. Accurate hull models, sail plans, guns, internal upgrades, historical speed trials were used in the creation of vessels. The game features 50+ ships from small cutters to large 100+ gun 1st rates allowing the player to experience every possible role of that era.Conquest and PVP ActivitiesFight for the domination of the West Indies, recreated based on 18th Century maps and navigational charts. Build ships, trade, attack enemies of your nation almost everywhere and capture their ships. Open trading outposts and levy taxes in the ports governed by your clan. Invest to turn your controlled ports into industrial hubs, shipbuilding arsenals or fortified harbours. Invite other clans of your nation into your alliance.Built for PVPAge of sail combat is a personal affair with no dirty tricks, corner camping, or hiding in bushes: you see the enemy from 20km and so do they. Just like in boxing you have to get close; and use all your tactical knowledge of wind, your ship to slug it out face to face. Broadside weight matters, but even a smaller vessel can overcome the superior enemy by focusing on the enemy weak spots.Absolutely no hackers.Hacking is a killer of fun in PVP games. From the start we have build the tech around one main goal - complete elimination of hacking from PVP. We are very proud to say that we have succeeded. Naval Action is one of the few games where hacking is made impossible by design. Every battle action is calculated on the servers, even water and wave shapes. Yes - you have heard it right: there is a special server that calculates and replicates waves to all users in battle. When fighting in Naval action you can be sure you are only facing skills and ship fittings.Other activitiesTutorials In-game tutorials and exams help you to grasp the basics and the subtleties of gunnery and maneuvering. Passing the final naval combat exam grants you the rank of Master and Commander, together with a frigate and other rewards to start your adventures in the West Indies.Admiralty missions Accomplish missions for your Admiralty to earn doubloons, combat medals and reward chests. Deliver cargo or passengers, hunt specific ships, join patrol zones battles and sink as many ships as you can.Trading and privateering Buy trading goods at low prices, haul them to distant places for high profits. Board ships and sell them and their cargo at nearby ports. Use shallow waters at your advantage to escape from larger ships.Shipbuilding and manufacturing - Build ships, upgrades and cannons, supply your clans or your nation or set up shops in free towns to sell to your enemies. FeaturesRealistic sailing Advanced wind and physics model provides for realistic portrayal of ships performance in the age of sail. Yard angles, ship angle to wind, fittings and ship condition affects speeds and turning rates. Correct tacking, boxhauling, clubhauling and other elements of realistic sailing will help you win battles in most adverse conditions. Gunnery and weapons Major types of naval artillery are implemented: from long guns to mortars to carronades and obusiers. Fort and land batteries will provide you with support during battles near shores. Mortar vessels can destroy fortifications, though they may require an escort. Each gun has realistic ballistics and penetration performance based on historical gun charts and admiralty tests.. Heel and wind affects the shooting distance and will require a change in tactics. Damage model Every cannonball is tracked in the air and after it hits the target. Leaks, structural damage, torn sails, demasting, raking, fires, explosions and all other hazards that were possible in that era. Damage is positional: hit the gun and you might destroy it. Gunnery crews are placed deck by deck. Shot can pass through the balcony, ricochet of the gun, hit a crew member and then fly out of the gunport splashing into the water. Armor thickness and wood types affect strength of the hull and cannonballs will ricochet from the hulls at extreme angles. Customization Choose economy and battle perks as you progress through higher ranks. Find knowledge books in enemy vessels and build upgrades to improve the performance of your ship. Loot or craft the shipbuilding woods that fit the characteristics you want to give to your future ship.

CPUCores does this by micromanaging your Windows OS and non-essential applications to delivery maximum CPU to your game!1) DIRECT STEAM INTEGRATION CPUCores automatically detects all of your Steam games.2) OS OPTIMIZATION To start, CPUCores will isolate your entire OS to your first core. Secondly, CPUCores examines and constrains key Windows services that are not essential and known to hog CPU resources. Third, CPUCores examines and isolate key Windows processes to ensure a perfect balance of CPU savings without starving key Windows processes.3) GAME OPTIMIZATION CPUCores will isolate and dedicate processing cores to be exclusively used by your game. CPUCores will allow game-specific hyper-thread disabling/enabling.4) BACKGROUND / NON-GAME OPTIMIZATIONS CPUCores examines what non-OS and non-game operations your PC is running. It will do things such as constrain non-game programs to your first processing core.5) EXTRAS Ability to ""START RANDOM GAME"" with 1 button click! Fully supporting VR games!

Convenient game sorting options makes large Steam libraries manageable Incredible community surrounding the software! Direct contact with the developer for suggestions on feature updates!The impact of how CPUCores will help with FPS depends on essentially 2 things: #1 Your PC Hardware#2 The game itselfHere are some benchmarks we've recently seen from our test system: ARMA III - 17.5% FPS Increase! Team Fortress 2 - 58% FPS Increase! TombRaider - 6.3% FPS Increase Left4Dead2 - 14% FPS IncreaseThe CPUCores application identifies dozens of Windows programs, background processes, and non-gaming applications, and immediately controls and isolates them to a subsection of your total CPU resources. CPUCores will then free up a block of CPU resources and dedicated it specifically for a game. You can then launch a Steam game, or any game/program, directly via the CPUCores application. This enables CPUCores to control the processor usage for that game/program and ensure it has dedicated usage to processing cores.

Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner.Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive.The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen.And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests.

Sitting in a remote forested valley, the dilapidated homestead will test all your abilities as you attempt to turn it into the most prosperous ranch in the region either alone or in up to four player co-op multiplayer.Rebuild Your RanchThe years have not been kind to your family ranch and it will take time and money to restore it to its former glory. Buy tools from the local hardware store and purchase a range of vehicles from the garage to help with your rebuilding projects. Renovate the main house, decide what livestock you want to farm and construct the barns, pens and runs youll need to keep them safe and secure.Look After Your LivestockGrand building projects are one thing. Paying for them? Thatll come down to your ranching skills. Overseeing a profitable operation is all about the day-to-day. Once youve selected and taken on your livestock, regular feeding and watering will keep them healthy. Successful breeding and careful rearing of the young will help boost the numbers in your herds and flocks and the more produce you have to sell, the more income youll receive for all that hard work.Head Out on the HuntTheres a large open-world environment outside your cosy homestead and its teeming with wildlife. So when you feel like slowing the pace, why not grab your trusty rifle and head out into the forest to stalk deer and hunt bears? But remember, the wilderness lives by its own laws and you arent the only skilled hunter in the neighbourhood.

Hades' Star,755800,0,True,Free To Play,"In Hades' Star, you create and grow a space Empire over time, in a persistent galaxy that constantly evolves. These are the star types discovered so far:Yellow StarsAs the most stable star type, the Yellow Star offers a perfect setting to establish your permanent presence and plan your Empire's long term economy. All new players start in their own Yellow Star system and over time expand to discover and colonize more planets, set mining patterns, establish trade routes and neutralize the mysterious alien ships found throughout the Hades galaxy. As the owner of a Yellow Star system, you have complete control over what other players have access to it. By establishing diplomatic relations, you can allow any other player to send ships to your system, and dictate your own terms for mining, trade or military cooperation.Red StarsVery early in the game, every player will build a Red Star Scanner, a station that allows them to jump ships to detected Red Stars. These stars have a small lifetime and will go supernova after 15 minutes.The goal in the Red Star is to co-operate with any other players that have ships in that star system, defeat the NPC ships, retrieve Artifacts from the Red Star planets, and jump back before the Supernova. Artifacts can be researched in the home star and will yield necessary resources for trade, mining and combat advancements. Higher level Red Stars offer more challenging enemies and better rewards.White StarsPlayers can organize in Corporations. Besides helping each other, Corporations can also scan for White Stars. A White Star sees up to 40 players from two Corporations battle in the same star system for Relics, a resource that can be retrieved to upgrade the Corporation and give each member additional benefits.Time passes by very slowly in White Stars: every match lasts for 5 days, giving Corporation members time to talk and coordinate their strategy. The Time Machine can be used to plan future moves, communicate them to other Corporation members, and see potential outcomes of future combat.Blue StarsThese short lived stars only last for 5 minutes, during which the entire system is collapsing on itself. Each player can only send a single Battleship to the Blue Star. The 5 participating players combat each other, using their ship's modules and other NPC ships to destroy the other player ships and be the last one alive.Blue Stars offer the fastest PvP action in the game.
